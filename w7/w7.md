## d-cluster-tilting
We want to check if a module is d-cluster-tilting. The example we will be working with is the following

```
A := NakayamaAlgebra([2,2,2], GF(3));;
In := AllIndecModulesOfLengthAtMost(A, 3);;
M := DirectSumOfQPAModules([In[1],In[4], In[5], In[6]]);;
```

We will check that M is d-cluster-tilting. In this example d=3. First we need to check that M is (d-1)-rigid

```
N_RigidModule(M, 2);
```

Next thing we need to check is that for indecomposable object N, which are not direct summands of M, then Ext^i(N,M) != 0, for some i=1,2..,d-1. Similarly that Ext^i(M,N) != 0, for some i=1,..,d-1.

To get a basis of Ext^i(M,N), run following command, and then 

```
    basis := ExtOverAlgebra(NthSyzygy(M,i-1), N)[2];
    dim := Size(basis);
```

In our case we get that

```
    Size(ExtOverAlgebra(NthSyzygy(M,0), In[2])[2]); # outputs: 1
    Size(ExtOverAlgebra(NthSyzygy(M,1), In[3])[2]); # outputs: 1
    Size(ExtOverAlgebra(NthSyzygy(In[2],1), M)[2]); # outputs: 1
    Size(ExtOverAlgebra(NthSyzygy(In[3],0), M)[2]); # outputs: 1
```

Notice, we didn't check the half the cases, where it will output 0. But this is enough to check that M is 2-cluster-tilting.
This code example, where the things are done manually is found in file `dct_example.g`. In `dct_example.g` is also some code that puts all this into a for loop, and checks it automatically.
A more general version of this is found in the file `dct.g`, where a general function `IsDClusterTilting(M, d, Indecs)` are defined and describes, which works for general algebra, and module (can also be found in the scripts directory).
